Subroutines (like add, sub) can use shared objective values.
- scoreboard variable as registers

## Behavior

### Subroutines
How much should user program?
In the point of view of the user:
* Are all functions hardcoded to use certain registers as parameter?
* Can they directly do something like: `add c a b` to mean `c = a + b`?

ex) `add c a b` gets converted to:

OUTPUT.mcfunction
```
1. move A, B to R0, R1 
2. run subroutine ADD
3. move RET to C
```

### Conditional jump and boolean expressions

#### proposed ideas:

1. Condition stack idea:

| user:         | internal:               |                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| CMPRST        | FLG = nil               | resets the flag register | 
| CMP and A > B | FLG = FLG && (A > B)    |                          |
| CMP and A > C | FLG = FLG && (A > C)    |                          |
| CMP or A != D | FLG = FLG \|\| (A != D) |                          |
| JIF addr      | jump if FLG is true.    |                          |

All the comparisons are either AND-ed or OR-ed with the `FLG` register. `JIF` will jump if `FLG` is set to true.

2. Evaluate the expression (C style):

| user:                           | internal:           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| CMP (A > B && A > C) \|\| A > D | TEMP = 1            |
|                                 | TEMP \*= int(A > B) |
|                                 | TEMP \*= int(A > C) |

Ofc, `cmp` will set the `FLG` register as true/false.

3. User evaluates the multiple condition:

| user:                | internal:                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| AND DEST1 R0 R1      | dest1 = r0 && r1         |
| OR DEST2 R0 R1       | dest2 = r0 \|\| r1       |
| AND cond DEST1 DEST2 | cond = dest1 && dest2    |
| JIF cond label       | jump if condition is met |

#### Decision
We choose option 3 because it is expandable and more like traditional assembly code. Expressions like in 2 can be easily converted to 3 in compile time.
