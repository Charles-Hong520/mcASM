### Error Demo

Basic error handleing is working. Thanks @charles.

### Designated Registers

By registers we mean scoreboard player values that will act like an register.

An instruction require (at least right now) three things: arg1, arg2, return. These values are passed into the subroutines, which are, by the way, named all lowercase, i.e. `add.mcfunction`.

| registers | full name       |
| --------- | --------------- |
| \_\_ARG1  | argument 1      |
| \_\_ARG2  | argument 2      |
| \_\_ARG3  | argument 3      |
| \_\_PC    | program counter |
| \_\_RET   | return value    |

These variables are prefixed with `__` to denote that it is a "private" values that should not be touched. 

### Code Generation

```
// suppose we have an add instruction at `lineNumber` in the assembly file:
lineNumber: add a b c

// c++ instruction will generate a file (lineNumber.mcfunction) that contains:
arg1 <- b 
arg2 <- c

// subroutine gets called.
call add.mcfunction

// finally the destination gets the return value.
a <- ret
```

We decide to use subroutines because it makes things more general. The add function will always operate with `arg1` and `arg2`. Hence, regardless of the assembly code--specifically whether we are using an integer immediate value or a variable--the complier will set the argument values for the subroutine which stays fixed and **outside of the C++ code**.
