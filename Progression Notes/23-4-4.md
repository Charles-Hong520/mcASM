### Polymorphism
* majority of the operations require 3 arguments.
* parent class has arg numbers as 3 by default.
* override arg numbers.

### Immediate Values
All numbers will start with a #.
add a #5
* better for later; can be extended to support other immediate values like floats.

### Program Counter
* handle various jump exceptions in compile time.
    * recall jumping foward and backward might require different handling bevahior.
    
```
main:
    if pc = 0: a()
    if pc = 1: b()
    if pc = 2: c()
    pc++;
    main()
```

Let's say a(), b(), c() are some operations. If c is a jump instruction to 0, we must set pc to be -1 so that pc++ will have no effect on the next call of main. 

But if a is a jump to 2, then we just let pc = 2 because we run c() before reaching the pc++.

If we don't want to do the above: A possible solution is to have a global within minecraft to keep track of whether we have executed a jump command. Depending on this, pc++  will only run when we have not jumped.

#### Solution
Handle various cases in compile time. Overall, it is faster since we don't have to keep track of the "state of jumping". We also get some benifits such as being able to execute multiple lines in a single call of main (if we jump foward).

We trade off readability on the complied file since the jump values will be offsetted based on whether we branch up or down.
